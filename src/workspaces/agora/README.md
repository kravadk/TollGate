# ArcMind — Autonomous Trading Intelligence

**App route:** `/app/agora`

## What it does

ArcMind is an autonomous trading agent that publishes its reasoning step by step, lets anyone copy-trade with $1 minimum, and hard-kills all positions when drawdown exceeds the threshold — all settled in USDC on Arc L1 via CCTP cross-chain transfers. Market data feeds (Hyperliquid OI, Polymarket sentiment, news sentiment, whale flows) are sold as sub-cent x402 Nanopayments.

## Features

| CCTP cross-chain arb | Detects USDC price gaps across Arc, Base, Arbitrum; executes via Circle CCTP |
| Copy-trading escrow | `CopyTradeEscrow.sol`: stake USDC, agent allocates + settles PnL automatically |
| Reasoning trace marketplace | Buy step-by-step ArcMind decision logs via x402; each trace includes Kelly sizing and outcome |
| Kill switch | When drawdown exceeds threshold: stops entries, liquidates escrows, posts on-chain kill event |
| Nanopayment data feeds | $0.001–$0.005/call for Hyperliquid OI, Polymarket, news sentiment, whale tracker |

## Kill switch mechanism

When cumulative drawdown exceeds the configured threshold (default 15%):
1. All new position entries are stopped
2. A `killSwitch` event is posted to `ArcMindRegistry` on-chain
3. All copy-trade escrows are liquidated at current mark price
4. A receipt is emitted for the forced exit — auditable by anyone via the registry

## Nanopayment economics

Signal calls are priced at $0.001–$0.005 per call. This works because x402 challenges are issued and verified server-side with no per-call gas cost; on-chain settlement is batched and amortised across many calls.
